# Project 1

Implementing a dynamic delta hedging strategy.

# The Assignment
Delta Hedge a portfolio using simulation and using real market data. 

# Getting Started
The easiest way to run the code is to use JetBrains' CLion. Navigate to the `main.cpp` and click run. This works best for mac and windows.

If you wish to compile from your command line, change into the directory where you downloaded the program. Then run:
```c++
g++ *.cpp
./a.out
```
You could also compile the C++ code and name the program you want to run. For example:
```c++
g++ -o <name-your-program-here> *.cpp
./newprogram
```

Make sure the csv files are in the same directory as all *.cpp files.
